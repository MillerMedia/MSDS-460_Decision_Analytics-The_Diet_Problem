    "## Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this linear programming problem is to determine the number of servings of each food item to consume per week in order to meet the minimum weekly nutritional requirements while minimizing the total cost of these food items. The five food items under consideration are Eggs, Hash Browns, Chobani Yogurt, Safeway Cobb Salad, and Canned Tuna. Each food item has a specific cost and provides varying amounts of nutrients such as calories, protein, vitamin D, calcium, iron, potassium, and sodium.\n",
    "\n",
    "The decision variables in this problem are the number of servings per week for each of the food items, which we'll represent as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **x1** = number of servings of Eggs per week\n",
    "- **x2** = number of servings of Hash Browns per week\n",
    "- **x3** = number of servings of Yogurt per week\n",
    "- **x4** = number of servings of Cobb Salad per week\n",
    "- **x5** = number of servings of Canned Tuna per week\n",
    "\n",
    "The **objective** of this problem is to minimize the total cost of the food consumed over the week, represented by the sum of the cost per serving of each food item multiplied by the number of servings consumed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **nutritional constraints** ensure that the minimum weekly intake for calories, protein, vitamin D, calcium, iron, and potassium is met, and that the sodium intake does not exceed the maximum allowed level. These constraints are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Total calories consumed must be at least 14,000 kcal (equivalent to 2,000 kcal per day for 7 days).\n",
    "- Total protein consumed must be at least 350 grams (equivalent to 50 grams per day for 7 days).\n",
    "- Total vitamin D consumed must be at least 140 micrograms.\n",
    "- Total calcium consumed must be at least 9,100 milligrams.\n",
    "- Total iron consumed must be at least 126 milligrams.\n",
    "- Total potassium consumed must be at least 32,900 milligrams.\n",
    "- Total sodium consumed should not exceed 35,000 milligrams (5,000 mg per day).\n",
    "\n",
    "These constraints ensure that a balanced diet is maintained over the week while minimizing costs.\n",

    "The results of the modified problem show that each food item has at least 1 serving per week.

For example, an additional 'hidden' variable that increases the cost if the same food item is consumed consecutively that could be used in the calculation.

    "1. Problem Description:\n",
    "The Diet Problem aims to find the least expensive combination of foods that will satisfy all nutritional requirements. We need to:\n",
    "- Minimize the total cost of the diet\n",
    "- Ensure all nutritional requirements are met\n",
    "- Stay within maximum allowances for certain nutrients\n",
    "- Use non-negative quantities of foods\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Implementation Details:\n",
    "- We use the `pulp` library for linear programming optimization\n",
    "- The model is parameterized to allow for easy modification of:\n",
    "  - Available foods and their costs\n",
    "  - Nutrients to consider\n",
    "  - Nutritional content of each food\n",
    "  - Minimum and maximum nutrient requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Key Features:\n",
    "- The code creates decision variables for each food\n",
    "- It sets up an objective function to minimize cost\n",
    "- It adds constraints for both minimum and maximum nutrient requirements\n",
    "- It returns detailed results including optimal cost, food amounts, and nutrients obtained\n",
    "\n",
    "To use this code for your assignment:\n",
    "1. Install the required library: `pip install pulp`\n",
    "2. Modify the sample data to match your specific problem requirements\n",
    "3. Run the code to get the optimal solution\n",
    "\n",
    "You can easily extend this model by:\n",
    "- Adding more foods or nutrients\n",
    "- Implementing additional constraints (e.g., maximum servings of specific foods)\n",
    "- Adding food groups or other categorizations\n",
    "\n",
    "Is there anything specific you'd like me to explain further or any modifications you need for your assignment?\n"

    "The output from Claude worked pretty well from the first prompt. When I asked for Python code, it made an assumption to use the `pulp` library and parameterized the function as I asked so it can be used for multiple different scenarios. It also provided a good explanation of the key components of the implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "An additional note on this is that Claude's UI made it very easy to extract the code it wrote as it put it in a panel on the right side with a button to download the code to a file directly (I have included this as the diet-problem-solver.py; which it named as well). This was very helpful and made the process much quicker and is different than the way ChatGPT outputs code in my experience.\n",
