# Diet Problem Solver
This project aims to solve a classic linear programming optimization problem called the Diet Problem. The objective is to determine the optimal number of servings of different food items to meet minimum nutritional requirements while minimizing the total cost.

## Problem Overview
The Diet Problem focuses on selecting a combination of five food items:

- Eggs
- Hash Browns
- Chobani Yogurt
- Safeway Cobb Salad
- Canned Tuna

Each food item provides specific nutrients, including:

- Calories
- Protein
- Vitamin D
- Calcium
- Iron
- Potassium
- Sodium

The goal is to create a balanced diet that satisfies the weekly nutritional constraints while minimizing the overall cost.

### Files Included
- diet-problem-solver.py: Python script, generated by Claude Sonnet 3.5, that contains a linear programming solution of the Diet Problem using the pulp library. It defines a function solve_diet_problem that solves the diet problem with customizable constraints and minimum servings.


- plain-text-llm-conversation.txt: A plain text file documenting the conversation with an LLM (Claude 3.5) used to assist with creating the model.


- part_3_results.txt: Output file generated after solving the diet problem for Part 3 of the notebook.


- part_4_results.txt: Output file generated after solving the modified diet problem in Part 4, where each food item is required to have at least one serving.


### Notebooks Contents

1. Problem Description  

The problem description includes defining decision variables for each food item, an objective function to minimize cost, and constraints to meet nutritional needs over a week.

2. Standard Formulation  

This section outlines the standard form of the linear programming problem, including decision variables, the objective function, and nutritional constraints for the five food items.

3. Solving the Problem 

Using Python's pulp library, the problem is solved to find the optimal number of servings for each food item, ensuring that the nutritional constraints are met. Results include total cost and weekly nutrient intake.

4. Adding Variety 

A modified version of the problem is introduced where each food item must have at least one serving per week to ensure dietary variety. The results show the impact of this additional constraint on cost and nutrient intake.

5. Usage of Large Language Models (LLMs) 

This part documents the use of a large language model (Claude 3.5 Sonnet) to assist with building the Python model for the diet problem. The file diet-problem-solver.py contains the final solution generated with LLM assistance.

### How to Use
- Install dependencies:  

```python
pip install pulp
```

- Run the notebook to execute the linear programming solver and obtain results for different problem variations.


- Modify the solve_diet_problem function to adjust constraints or add new food items as needed.
